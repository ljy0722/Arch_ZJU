You need to update the `controller.v` `datapath.v` `mips_define.vh` `mips_core.v` `alu.v` `inst_mem.hex` in the base of Topic4.<br>
We have pass the simulation, with the instruction limit, the final simulation map is not same, the tiem is just about 1,600ns to get this map...<br>
The `fwd_m_mem` and `fwd_a_ctrl` and `fwd_b_ctrl` are not same as standard simulation by TA. However, the register value are totally consistent.
